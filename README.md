# Major-Project-of-Sign-Language-Recognition-System
Sign Language Recognition System Using Computer Vision and Deep Learning for  Real-Time Gesture-to-Text and Speech  
A real-time hand gesture recognition system that detects numerical sign language gestures (1, 2, 3, …) using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.
This project captures hand gestures through a webcam, extracts landmarks, classifies gestures, and displays the recognized sign on-screen.

🚀 Features

 Real-time video capture using webcam
 Hand detection using MediaPipe
 Landmark extraction (21 hand keypoints)
 Classification of numeric gestures (1, 2, 3…)
 Graphical output showing detected gesture
 Lightweight, fast, and works on any device with a camera
 Easy-to-understand code (perfect for students & beginners)
